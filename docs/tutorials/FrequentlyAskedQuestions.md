**Q: Why am I not able to export?**

A: It is possible you have a popup-blocker such as AdBlock Plus installed.

**Q: How can I make SVG-edit save files on my server?**

A: As of SVG-edit 2.5.1, an extension is available that overrides the
default open/save behavior and instead uses PHP files to allow proper
open/save dialog boxes. You can include the extension by adding
`ext-server_opensave.js` to the `curConfig.extension` array
or through other methods mentioned on our [ConfigOptions]{@tutorial ConfigOptions} page.

For other server-saving behavior you may wish to modify
`ext-server_opensave.js` or the `filesave.php` file, both available
under `editor/extensions/`.

**Q: How can I serve SVG graphic editor from my own server?**

  assuming they are still valid -->

**Q: How can I set the stroke to 'none'?**

A: Shift-clicking palette squares sets the Stroke paint value. Thus,
you can `shift-click` on the None box (red x on white background) to
clear the Stroke paint.

**Q: How can I select an element when it's hidden or behind another one?**

A: Select an object. `Shift+O` will select the previous object `Shift+P`
will select the next object. Using the wireframe mode may also help in
seeing hidden objects.

**Q: How can I edit shapes that have been grouped?**

A: Double-click the group and you will shift the editing context to the
group. The rest of the image will not be editable while you are in the
group context. Once you are done editing inside the group, press Escape.

**Q: Can I trace over a raster (PNG, JPEG...) image?**

A: Yes, there are two methods you can use as of SVG-edit 2.4.

1. Go to the Document Properties, and enter the URL of the image under
  "Editor Background". This image will then fill the background without
  being saved as part of the image.
1. Add a layer from the layer panel. Then draw a raster image (image icon)
  and enter your URL. Use the layer above this one to trace over the image
  without moving. Note that you can also hide/show layers to help your work.

**Q: How do I copy the style of an object to other(s)?**

A:

- Select the object you want to copy the style from. You'll see its Fill and
  Stroke style attributes displayed in the bottom toolbar.
- Holding Shift to keep the first object selected, select one or several
  other objects.
- Open the colorpicker by clicking on the color blocks in the bottom
  toolbar. If you want to copy the fill, select the Fill block. If you
  want to copy the stroke, select the Stroke block.
- Hit "Ok" in the colorpicker

The other objects will get the Fill or the Stroke of the first object.
