# Canvas

While the Canvas works with the [Editor]{@tutorial EditorAPI}, it can also
work on its own.

Its methods can be summarized here.

See also the [JSDocs entry for Canvas]{@link module:svgcanvas}.

## Exposed `svgCanvas` private methods and properties

These are supplied in an object supplied as the first parameter to each
extension function (see [ExtensionDocs]{@tutorial ExtensionDocs} for
an example and information).

See their [JSDocs API]{@link module:svgcanvas.PrivateMethods}.

## Canvas events

See [Events]{@tutorial Events} (under "Canvas events").
