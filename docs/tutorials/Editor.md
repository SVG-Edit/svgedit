# Editor

This document is for detailing usage of the Editor by regular users (as
opposed to the [API of the Editor for programmers]{@tutorial EditorAPI}).

Until we may flesh this document out further, we may begin with tips on the
features which are more non-obvious as to usage (including for novices to
graphic design). Feel free to file an issue to request documentation on a
particular feature.

See also some possibly out-of-date documentation at
[FrequentlyAskedQuestions]{@tutorial FrequentlyAskedQuestions}.

## Paths

When working with a path (as created by the Path tool left ("mode")
toolbar item or "Convert to Path" in the "context" toolbar at the
top), chosen by the "Select" left-toolbar item, clicking the item once
will allow the normal resizing/rotation, and clicking the item again
will allow for independent manipulation of the path and display a
different context-dependent toolbar at the top of the screen.
