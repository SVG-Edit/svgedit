SVG-edit is a community-managed project with the general principles of Free and Open Source software and Open Organizations.

The current admins are: * Ahmad Syazwan * Brion Vibber * Jeff Schiller * Marc Laporte * Pavol Rusnak

Admins rarely need to vote because decisions are usually consensual and it's a [doOcracy](http://www.communitywiki.org/en/DoOcracy). When a vote is required, these are the people (ex.: for legal/political reasons such as a formal motion needed for external needs). Admins are voted in by other admins.
Ongoing responsibilities of the Admins

    Add/remove commit access for contributors
    They also act as a safe guard, as a last resort, to deal with [Difficult People](http://producingoss.com/en/difficult-people.html) or [Poisonous People](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSFDm3UYkeE).
