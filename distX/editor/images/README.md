this directory contains images used for...
- custom tool extension buttons (i.e. bluetriangle, soccernet, etc.)
- overrides of the default tools (i.e. select, delete, undo, etc.)
THESE IMAGES MUST BE COPIED INTO THE /editor/images DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO BE USED
(this directory is simply to better identify our customized images vs those in SVGEdit)
