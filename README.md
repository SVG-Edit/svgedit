# IMAGE-TactileAuthoring

IMAGE-TactileAuthoring builds on the existing SVGEdit project to support tactile graphic authoring by modifying the renderings produced by the [IMAGE-server](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-server) or creating the graphics from scratch. Currently, the tactile graphics produced in SVG format are only used by the [IMAGE-Monarch](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-Monarch) client application. However, this tool is extensible to other client applications and device types built to comply with the guidelines described here: [Link to guidelines](https://github.com/Shared-Reality-Lab/IMAGE-Monarch?tab=readme-ov-file#tactile-graphics). 

Additionally, this project includes a UI prototype to link the svg-editor with the IMAGE Extension.
