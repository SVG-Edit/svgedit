## 4.0.0

- Breaking change (storage preference cookies): Namespace the cookie as
  "svgeditstore" instead of just "store"
- Breaking change: `loadSvgString` now returns a `Promise` rather than
  accepting a callback.
- Breaking change: Treat callbacks to `editor.ready` as Promises, only
  resolving after all resolve. May require no changes unless for timing.
- Breaking change: Make `editor.runCallbacks` return a `Promise` which
  resolves upon all callbacks resolving.
- Breaking change: Require `npx` (used with `babel-node`) to allow Node files
  for HTML building and JSDoc type checking to be expressed as ESM.

  argument, collapsing fifth (options) to fourth
- Breaking change (API): Remove `svgCanvas.exportPDF` third (callback)

  its plugins, e.g., dbox with its `alert`
- Enhancement: Use alert dialog in place of `alert` in webappfind
- Enhancement: `editor.ready` now returns a Promise resolving when all
  callbacks have resolved
- Enhancement: Allow `noAlert` option as part of second argument to
  `loadSvgString` (and `loadFromURL` and `loadFromDataURI`) to avoid UI
  alert (and trigger promise rejection)
- Enhancement: Make `dbox` as a separate module for alert, prompt, etc. dialogs
- Optimization: Recompress images (imageoptim-cli updated)
- Refactoring: Internal `PaintBox` as class; other misc. tweaks; no bitwise

    JSDoc code comments though disable `jsdoc/valid-types` rule for now due to <https://github.com/Kuniwak/jsdoctypeparser/issues/47> and disable rule
    `jsdoc/require-param` due to
    <https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-jsdoc/issues/100>; also of

  for overly generic types (though allow for `.Function` as in
  `jQuery.Function`) and avoid one previously missed instance

  reuse
- Docs: Mention potentially more frequent release schedule
- npm: Update "grep-doc" to "types-doc" for greater clarity
- npm: Per convention, switch Node-based (headless browser) testing script to
    `npm test` and change the browser tests to "browser-test"

## 3.1.0

- Fix (Embedded editor): (Though cross-origin DOM access of iframes apparently
  doesn't work now in Chrome or Firefox (which we had been using to disable a
  button) nor does cross-origin storage access work in Chrome), PDF export has
  been fixed (we download the PDF to workaround data URI limitations in Chrome)
  and we avoid opening an extra tab in Chrome PNG export
- Fix (Embedded editor): Avoid using same origin shortcut if there is no
  global available to use (e.g., if using the modular editor)
- Fix (Embedded editor): Add events only after load is complete and
  svgCanvas is available; also log blocked error objects
- Fix: Have export handler, if triggered, always open a window even if no
  window name was given (needed in Chrome to avoid opening an extra window)
- Enhancement: For anyone visiting the ES6 modules entrance file without ESM
    support, redirect to non-modular version
- Enhancement: For PDF export, switch Chrome by default to "save" `outputType`
- Enhancement: Add `opts` object to `rasterExport` with `avoidEvent` property
  to avoid calling the `exported` event
- Refactoring (canvg): Better type-checking on `canvasRGBA_` (but set
  correctly by default anyways)
- Refactoring: Avoid redundant use of \*AttributeNS methods with
  `null` value; just use \*Attribute methods without namespace
- Refactoring: Display inline styles within a template for readability
  (until we may refactor as class swapping)
- Refactoring: Line breaks
- Refactoring: Reorder path config to group (non-modular-dependent) image
  paths together (and correct code comment)
- Docs (CHANGES): clarifications/fixes
- Docs (README): Deemphasize unstable embedded editor fixes
- Docs: Versions section (for migrating)
- Docs: More info on `importLocale` for extensions
- Docs: Add code comment re: use of `extIconsPath` in Mathjax
- Docs (JSDoc): Denote optional arguments
- Docs (JSDoc): Add @this to indicate `ExtensionInitResponse#callback`
- Build: Add comment not to edit xdomain editor directly
- Build: Remove unused `Makefile`

## 3.0.1

- Fix: Revert fix to have extension `mouseup` events run on "zoom" and
  "select" modes (#159); breaks polygon selection
- Fix (jgraduate->jpicker): Actually fix issue with color val check when no
  other proper results (equal to "all"); prior fix had not covered
  original intention

## 3.0.0

- See pre-release version notes below for other changes that are a part
  of 3.0.0
- Breaking change: For checkbox for persisting choice of initial use storage
  approval in storage extension dialog, turn on by default for convenience of
  most users (must still hit "ok" and users can still turn off the checkbox)
- Breaking change: Remove `storagePromptClosed` state boolean in favor of
    `storagePromptState`; used by `ext-storage.js`
- Fix: Map extension click events to "mousedown" so they can be received
    on touch devices (since `touch.js` changes `touchstart` to
    `mousedown`) (@ClemArt); closes #168
- Fix: Ensure extension `mouseup` events run on "zoom" and "select"
  modes (@iuyiuy); closes #159
- Fix: Allow language to be properly set back to a different locale and
  retaining preference (and ensure language changes are available before
  dialog closed)
- Fix: Centering of canvas wasn't being set at proper time; fixes #272
- Fix (extensions): Ensure `langReady` changes are available by time prefs
  dialog is closed and that its changes have occurred by time extensions
  have first loaded (`setLang` now returns a Promise rather than `undefined`
  as it waits for extension's `langReady` to resolve); this is also useful
  with `ext-storage.js` so we know that `extensions_loaded` (which
  conditionally updates the canvas based on `storagePromptState`) has seen
  `langReady` and the storage extension hasn't set a `storagePromptState`
  of "waiting"
- Fix (regression): Extension locale loading for non-English locales
- Enhancement: Allow "Escape" to work with hotkeys within text boxes;
  allows escaping out of source textarea (part of #291)
- Enhancement: Allow 'a' also with meta key (command in Mac, ctrl otherwise)
  to select all (part of #291)
- Enhancement: Add a global escape key listener to clear the selection
- Refactoring: Change 'a' to lower case in key command to avoid impression
  that shift is needed
- Refactoring: Avoid unneeded internal IIFEs; simplify w/h formula
- Refactoring: array extra/spread operator
- npm: Update devDeps

## 3.0.0-rc.3

- Security fix: Ensure all apostrophes are escaped for `toXml` utility
- Security fix/Breaking change (Imagelib): Only allow origins within
  `imgLibs` to be accepted for `message` listener
- Security fix/Breaking change (xdomain): Namespace xdomain file to avoid
  it being used to modify non-xdomain storage
- Security fix (Imagelib): Avoid XSS
- Security fix (Imagelib): Expose `dropXMLInternalSubset` to extensions
  for preventing billion laughs attack (and use in Imagelib)
- Security fix (minor): For embedded API, avoid chance for arbitrary
  property setting (though this was only for trusted origins anyways)
- Security fix (minor): For embedded API example, copy params to iframe
  source without XSS risk (though params should already be XML-safe
  given `encodeURIComponent` and lack of a single quote attribute
  context)
- Situational regression: Remove Openclipart as its site's now setting of
  `X-Frame-Options` to `"sameorigin"` makes it unusable on our end
  for our cross-origin uses (even with an attempt to use their API)
- Breaking change (minor): Change export to check `exportWindowName`
  for filename and change default from `download` to `svg.pdf` to
  distinguish from other downloads
- Fix: Given lack of support now for dataURI export in Chrome, provide
  PDF download as export (#273 @cuixiping); fixes #124 and #254
- Fix: Polygon/polyline in PDF export (#287 @cuixiping); fixes #280
- Fix: Avoid error if `URL` is not defined (export)
- Fix: Ensure repeated selection of same file overwrites with that
  file's contents (fix #289)
- Fix: Avoid errors occurring in Chrome now for `supportsGoodTextCharPos`
- Fix (jPicker): Avoid setting `Math.precision` pseudo-global
- Fix (jPicker): Precision argument had not been passed in previously
- Fix (image import): Put src after onload to avoid missing event;
  check other width/height properties in case offset is 0; fixes #278
- Fix (image export): Export in Chrome; fixes #282
- Fix (Context menus regression): Avoid showing double shortcuts (#285); add
  some missing ones
- Fix (Star extension): Minor: Avoid erring if `inradius` is `NaN`
- Forward compatibility enhancement: Once IE9 support may be dropped,
  we may post messages as objects, so don't break if objects received
  (embedded API, xdomain, Imagelib)
- Forward compatibility enhancement: For IAN image library, add
  `svgedit=3` param to URL so that it can keep using old API for
  SVG-Edit versions before 3, while conditionally using new object-based
  API now (and if we switch exclusively to the object-based API in the
  future, this site will continue to work)
- Imagelib backward compatibility regression fix: Allow string based API
  again so as not to break old SVG-Edit which fail at *presence* of
  `namespace` (fixes #274)
- Refactoring: Avoid passing unused arguments, setting unused variables,
  and making unnecessary checks; avoid useless call to `createSVGMatrix`
- Refactoring: Avoid useless assignment (courtesty lgtm)
- Refactoring: Destructuring, spread
- Refactoring (jPicker): Use ES6 templates; avoid unnecessary check
- Linting (LGTM): Add `lgtm.yml` file (still some remaining items flagged
  but hoping for in-code flagging)
- Linting (LGTM): Flag origin-checked item as safe
- Linting (ESLint): Consistent spacing; new "standard"
- Testing: Add testcafe (ESLint plugin/rules, accessibility test
  (failing), ui test beginnings (passing))
- Docs: Contributing file
- Docs (JSDoc): Missing return value
- Update (Imagelib): Remove extra (and more outdated) jQuery copy
- Build (prerelease change): Switch to `terser` plugin with `uglify`
  plugin not supporting ES6+-capable minifier
- npm: Update devDeps
- npm: Point to official sinon-test package now that ES6 Modules
    support landed

## 3.0.0-rc.2

- Fix: Avoid extension `includeWith` button conflicts/redundancies;
  Incorporates #147
- Fix: Ensure shift-key cycling through flyouts works with extension-added
  `includeWith` as well as toolbarbuttons
- Fix: Apply flyout arrows after extensions loaded (avoid race condition)
- Fix: Ensure SVG icon of flyout right-arrow is cloned so can be applied to
  more than one extension
- Fix: Ensure line tool shows as selected when "L" key command is used
- Fix: Add images (and references) for fallback (#135)
- Fix (svgIcons plugin regression): Race condition
- Fix (canvg): Regression for `text` and `tspan` elements as far as
  `captureTextNodes` with canvg (inheriting class had set
  `captureTextNodes` too late)

- Fix (canvg): Avoid errors for `tspan` passed to `getGradient`
- Fix (regression): Reapply locale strings
- i18n: picking stroke/fill paint and opacity

  from URL setting
- Breaking change: Rename "svgutils.js" to "utilities.js" (make in

  is set to editor, including for `callback`)
- Breaking change: Locale now formatted as export
- Breaking change: `RGBColor` must accept `new`
- Breaking change: Avoid passing `canvg`/`buildCanvgCallback` to extensions
  (have them import)

## 3.0.0-alpha.2

- Licensing: Indicate MIT is license type of rgbcolor and rename
  file to reflect it; rename/add license file name for jgraduate
  and screencast to reflect type (Apache 2.0);
  contains license information (of type MIT) for Raphael icons
- Breaking change: Rename config file to `svgedit-config-iife.js` (or
  for the module version, `svgedit-config-es.js`); also expect
  one directory higher; incorporates #207 (@iuyiuy)
- Breaking change: Separate `extIconsPath` from `extPath` (not copying
  over icons)
- Breaking change: Don't reference `custom.css` in HTML; can instead
  be referenced in JavaScript through the config file (provided in `svgedit-config-sample-iife.js`/`svgedit-config-sample-es.js` as
  `svgedit-custom.css` for better namespacing); incorporates #207 (@iuyiuy)
- Breaking change: Remove minified jgraduate/spinbtn files (minified within
  Rollup routine)
- Breaking change: Require `new` with `EmbeddedSVGEdit` (allows us to use
  `class` internally)

    * Screencast `showNotes`
- Fix: Bad scope closure references
    * An apparent bug in `jquery.svgicons.js` whereby a variable
        `holder` was declared in too nested of a scope
    * Fix: Avoid `drawnPath` not defined error (currently adds as a global, but
        should be switching to modules anyways)
- Fix (jquery.jgraduate.js): Ensure `numstops` is present before check
- Fix (history.js) Relocation of rotational transform had undeclared
  variable (`elem`)
- Fix (Editor): Restore save alert
- Fix (Firefox svgutils.js): tspan (and textPath apparently) have no `getBBox`
    in Firefox, so recover (fixes FF issue with recalculate test 3:
    "recalculateDimensions() on text w/tspan with simple translate")
- Fix (Chrome recalculate.js): Chrome has a
    [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=843901)
    in not performing `removeAttribute` after `removeItem`; deal with it
    (though only if there is a single identity matrix) (fixes Chrome issue
    with recalculate test 1:
    "recalculateDimensions() on rect with identity matrix")
- Fix (HTML): Update assorted links, including using `https://`
- Enhancement: ES6 modules (including jQuery plugins, extensions, locales,
  tests), along with Babel; make Node build routine for converting modular
  HTML source to non-modular
- Enhancement: use `loadStylesheets` for modular stylesheet defining
  (but parallel loading)
- Enhancement: Add `stylesheets` config for modular but parallel
  stylesheet loading with `@default` option for simple
  inclusion/exclusion of defaults (if not going with default).

- Enhancement: Make SpinButton plugin independent of SVGEdit via
  generic state object for `tool_scale`
- Enhancement: Move `config-sample.js` out of `editor` directory
- Enhancement: For `callback`-style extensions, also provide config
  object; add following to that object: `buildCanvgCallback`, `canvg`,

  `import` support to refactor this)
- Refactoring (imagelib): Add local jQuery copy (using old 1.4.4 as had
  been using from server)
- Refactoring (MathJax): Add local copy (using old 2.3 as had been using from

## 2.8 (Ellipse) - November 24th, 2015

For a complete list of changes run:

```console
git log 4bb15e0..253b4bf
```

- Enhancement (Experimental): Client-side PDF export
  (issue [#1156](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1156))
  (to data: URI) and server-side PDF export (where not supported in browser
  and using ext-server_opensave.js); uses
  [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) library
- Enhancement: For image exports, provided "datauri" property to "exported"
  event.
- Enhancement: Allow config "exportWindowType" of value "new" or "same" to
  indicate whether to reuse the same export window upon subsequent exports
- Enhancement: Added openclipart support to imagelib extension
- Enhancement: allow showGrid to be set before load
- Enhancement: Support loading of (properly URL encoded) non-base64
  "data:image/svg+xml;utf8,"-style data URIs
- Enhancement: More clear naming of labels: "Open Image"->"Open SVG" and
  "Import SVG"->"Import Image" ( issue [#1206](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1206))
- Enhancement: Included reference to (repository-ignored) `custom.css` file
  which once created by the user, as with config.js, allows customization
  without modifying the repo (its main editor file)
- Enhancement: Updated Slovenian locale.
- Demo enhancement: Support and demonstrate export in embedded editor
- Upgrade: canvg version
- Upgrade: Added PathSeg polyfill to workaround pathseg removal in browsers.
- Fix: pathtool bug where paths were erroneously deleted.
- Fix: Context menu did not work for groups.
- Fix: Avoid error in ungrouping function when no elements selected (was
  impacting MathJax "Ok" button).
- Fix: issue [#1205](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1205)
  with Snap to Grid preventing editing
- Fix: bug in exportImage if svgEditor.setCustomHandlers calls made
- Fix: Ensure "loading..." message closes upon completion or error
- Fix: Ensure all dependencies are first available before canvg (and jsPDF) usage
- Fix: Allow for empty images
- Fix: Minor improvement in display when icon size is set to small
- Fix: Based64-encoding issues with Unicode text (e.g., in data URIs or icons)
- Fix: 2.7 regression in filesave.php for SVG saving (used by
  `ext-server_opensave.js` when client doesn't support the download attribute)
- Potentially breaking API changes (subject to further alteration before release):
    * Remove 2.7-deprecated "pngsave" (in favor of "exportImage")
    * Data URIs must be properly URL encoded (use encodeURIComponent() on the
      "data:..." prefix and double encodeURIComponent() the remaining content)
    * Remove "paramurl" parameter (use "url" or "source" with a data: URI instead)
    * svgCanvas.rasterExport now takes an optional window name as the third
      argument, with the supplied name also being provided as a
      "exportWindowName" property on the object passed to the [exportImage](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/wiki/ExtensionDocs#svgEditor_public_methods) method optionally supplied to svgEditor.setCustomHandlers.
    * Change 2.7 allowance of "PDF" as a type in the canvas "rasterExport"
      method and the "exported" event to instead be moved to the canvas
      "exportPDF" method and "exportedPDF" event respectively.

## 2.7.1 (applied to 2.7 branch) - April 17, 2014

- Fix important ID situation with embedded API
- Update functions available to embedded editor

## 2.7 (Deltoid curve) - April 7th, 2014

- Export to PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP (including quality control for JPEG/WEBP)
  for default editor and for the server_opensave extension
- Added Star, Polygon, and Panning Extensions r2318 r2319 r2333
- Added non-default extension, ext-xdomain-messaging.js, moving cross-origin
  messaging code (as used by the embedded editor) out of core and requiring,
  when the extension IS included, that configuration (an array
  "allowedOrigins") be set in order to allow access by any domain (even
  same domain).
- Cause embedded editor to pass on URL arguments to the child editor
  (child iframe)
- Added default extension, ext-storage.js moving storage setting code into
  this (optional) extension; contains dialog to ask user whether they wish
  to utilize local storage for prefs and/or content; provides configuration
  options to tweak behaviors.
- Allow for a new file config.js within the editor folder (but not committed
  to SVN and ignored) which is always loaded and can be used for supplying
  configuration which happens early enough to affect URL or user storage
  configuration, in addition to extension behavior configuration. Provided
  `config-sample.js` to indicate types of configuration one could use
  (see also `defaultPrefs`, `defaultExtensions`, and `defaultConfig` within
  `svg-editor.js`)
- Added configuration `preventAllURLConfig`, `lockExtensions`, and/or
  `preventURLContentLoading` for greater control of what can be configured
  via URL.
- Allow second argument object to setConfig containing
  `allowInitialUserOverride` booleans to allow for preference config in
  `config.js` to be overridden by URL or preferences in user storage;
  also can supply "overwrite" boolean in 2nd argument object if set to
  `false` to prevent overwriting of any prior-set configuration (URL
  config/pref setting occurs in this manner automatically for
  security reasons).
- Allow server_opensave extension to work wholly client-side (if
  browser supports the download attribute)
- Added WebAppFind extension
- Added new php_savefile extension to replace outdated, non-functioning
  server-save code; requires user to create `savefile_config.php` file
  and do any validation there (for their own security)
- Use addEventListener for 'beforeunload' event so user can add their
  own if desired
- Changed locale behavior to always load from locale file, including
  English. Allow extensions to add new `langReady` callback which is passed
  an object with `lang` and `uiStrings` properties whenever the locale data
  is first made available or changed by the user (this callback will not
  be invoked until the locale data is available). Extensions can add
  strings to all locales and utilize this mechanism.
- Made fixes impacting path issues and also ext-connector.js
- Fixed a bug where the position number supplied on an extension object
  was too high (e.g., if too few other extensions were included,
  the extension might not show up because its position was set too high).
- Added Polish locale
- Zoom features
- Make extension paths relative within extensions (issue 1184)
- Security improvements and other fixes
- Embedded editor can now work same domain without JSON parsing and the
  consequent potential loss of arguments or return values.
- Potentially breaking API changes:
    * Disallowed "extPath", "imgPath", "langPath", and "jGraduatePath"
      setting via URL and prevent cross-origin/cross-folder extensions
      being set by URL (security enhancement)
    * Deprecated "pngsave" option called by setCustomHandlers() in favor
      of "exportImage" (to accommodate export of other image types).
      Second argument will now supply, in addition to "issues" and
      "svg", the properties "type" (currently 'PNG', 'JPEG', 'BMP',
      'WEBP'), "mimeType", and "quality" (for 'JPEG' and 'WEBP' types).
    * Default extensions will now always load (along with those supplied
      in the URL unless the latter is prohibited by configuration), so
      if you do not wish your old code to load all of the default
      extensions, you will need to add `&noDefaultExtensions=true` to the
      URL (or add equivalent configuration in `config.js`).
      `ext-overview_window.js` can now be excluded though it is still
      a default.
    * Preferences and configuration options must be within the list supplied
      within `svg-editor.js` (should include those of all documented
      extensions).
    * Embedded messaging will no longer work by default for privacy/data
      integrity reasons. One must include the `ext-xdomain-messaging.js`
      extension and supply an array configuration item, `allowedOrigins`
      with potential values including: "\*" (to allow all
      origins--strongly discouraged!), "null" as a string to allow
      `file:///` access, window.location.origin (to allow same domain
      access), or specific trusted origins. The embedded editor works
      without the extension if the main editor is on the same domain,
      but if cross-origin control is needed, the `allowedOrigins` array
      must be supplied by a call to
      `svgEditor.setConfig({allowedOrigins: [origin1, origin2, etc.]})`
      in the new `config.js` file.
