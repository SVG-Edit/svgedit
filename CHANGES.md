# ?

* Fix: Broken "lv" locale (and inconsistent tabs/spaces pt-PR)
* Fix: Inadvertent global assignments (uncovered by ESLint):
    * `addBezierCurve` in `canvg.js` had undeclared `i`
    * Fix: Undeclared variable in opera widget
    * jgraduate->jpicker: Fix missing `var` for some `i` loops
    * Fix: Globals (`x`, `y`) in `mouseMove`
    * Fix: Global (`element`, `d_attr` (now renamed to `dAttr`)) in `mouseDown`
    * Testing (math_test): Fix undeclared variables
    * Screencast `showNotes`
- Fix: Bad scope closure references
    * An apparent bug in `jquery.svgicons.js` whereby a variable
        `holder` was declared in too nested of a scope
    * Fix: Avoid `drawnPath` not defined error (currently adds as a global, but
        should be switching to modules anyways)
* Fix (jgraduate->jpicker): Fix Color val check when `name.length` is empty
    (equal to "all")
* Fix (jquery.jgraduate.js): Ensure `numstops` is present before check
* Fix (history.js) Relocation of rotational transform had undeclared variable (`elem`)
* Fix (Editor): Restore save alert
* Fix (Firefox svgutils.js): tspan (and textPath apparently) have no `getBBox`
    in Firefox, so recover (fixes FF issue with recalculate test 3:
    "recalculateDimensions() on text w/tspan with simple translate")
* Fix (Chrome recalculate.js): Chrome has a
    [bug](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=843901)
    in not performing `removeAttribute` after `removeItem`; deal with it
    (though only if there is a single identity matrix) (fixes Chrome issue
    with recalculate test 1:
    "recalculateDimensions() on rect with identity matrix")
* Build: Update minified version of spinbtn/jgraduate/jpicker per linted/improved files
* Enhancement: Throw Error objects instead of strings (including in jgraduate->jpicker)
* Enhancement: Use minified version of jpicker in svg-editor
* Refactoring: Switch to ESLint in source
* Refactoring: Move scripts to own files
* npm: Add ESLint, uglify, start scripts
* Testing: Move JavaScript out of HTML to own files
* Testing: Add `node-static` to get tests working
* Testing: Fix timing of `all_tests.html` for ensuring expanding iframe size to fit content
* Testing: Add favicon to test files (also may avoid extra log in console)

# 2.8 (Ellipse) - November 24th, 2015

For a complete list of changes run:

```console
git log 4bb15e0..253b4bf
```

* Enhancement (Experimental): Client-side PDF export (issue [#1156](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1156)) (to data: URI) and server-side PDF export (where not supported in browser and using ext-server_opensave.js); uses [jsPDF](https://github.com/MrRio/jsPDF) library
* Enhancement: For image exports, provided "datauri" property to "exported" event.
* Enhancement: Allow config "exportWindowType" of value "new" or "same" to indicate whether to reuse the same export window upon subsequent exports
* Enhancement: Added openclipart support to imagelib extension
* Enhancement: allow showGrid to be set before load
* Enhancement: Support loading of (properly URL encoded) non-base64 "data:image/svg+xml;utf8,"-style data URIs
* Enhancement: More clear naming of labels: "Open Image"->"Open SVG" and "Import SVG"->"Import Image" ( issue [#1206](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1206))
* Enhancement: Included reference to (repository-ignored) custom.css file which once created by the user, as with config.js, allows customization without modifying the repo (its main editor file)
* Enhancement: Updated Slovenian locale.
* Demo enhancement: Support and demonstrate export in embedded editor
* Upgrade: canvg version
* Upgrade: Added PathSeg polyfill to workaround pathseg removal in browsers.
* Fix: pathtool bug where paths were erroneously deleted.
* Fix: Context menu did not work for groups.
* Fix: Avoid error in ungrouping function when no elements selected (was impacting MathJax "Ok" button).
* Fix: issue [#1205](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/detail?id=1205) with Snap to Grid preventing editing
* Fix: bug in exportImage if svgEditor.setCustomHandlers calls made
* Fix: Ensure "loading..." message closes upon completion or error
* Fix: Ensure all dependencies are first available before canvg (and jsPDF) usage
* Fix: Allow for empty images
* Fix: Minor improvement in display when icon size is set to small
* Fix: Based64-encoding issues with Unicode text (e.g., in data URIs or icons)
* Fix: 2.7 regression in filesave.php for SVG saving (used by ext-server_opensave.js when client doesn't support the download attribute)
* Potentially breaking API changes (subject to further alteration before release):
    * Remove 2.7-deprecated "pngsave" (in favor of "exportImage")
    * Data URIs must be properly URL encoded (use encodeURIComponent() on the "data:..." prefix and double encodeURIComponent() the remaining content)
    * Remove "paramurl" parameter (use "url" or "source" with a data: URI instead)
    * svgCanvas.rasterExport now takes an optional window name as the third argument, with the supplied name also being provided as a "exportWindowName" property on the object passed to the [exportImage](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/wiki/ExtensionDocs#svgEditor_public_methods) method optionally supplied to svgEditor.setCustomHandlers.
    * Change 2.7 allowance of "PDF" as a type in the canvas "rasterExport" method and the "exported" event to instead be moved to the canvas "exportPDF" method and "exportedPDF" event respectively.


# 2.7.1 (applied to 2.7 branch) - April 17, 2014

* Fix important ID situation with embedded API
* Update functions available to embedded editor

# 2.7 (Deltoid curve) - April 7th, 2014

* Export to PNG, JPEG, BMP, WEBP (including quality control for JPEG/WEBP) for default editor and for the server_opensave extension
* Added Star, Polygon, and Panning Extensions r2318 r2319 r2333
* Added non-default extension, ext-xdomain-messaging.js, moving cross-domain messaging code (as used by the embedded editor) out of core and requiring, when the extension IS included, that configuration (an array "allowedOrigins") be set in order to allow access by any domain (even same domain).
* Cause embedded editor to pass on URL arguments to the child editor (child iframe)
* Added default extension, ext-storage.js moving storage setting code into this (optional) extension; contains dialog to ask user whether they wish to utilize local storage for prefs and/or content; provides configuration options to tweak behaviors.
* Allow for a new file config.js within the editor folder (but not committed to SVN and ignored) which is always loaded and can be used for supplying configuration which happens early enough to affect URL or user storage configuration, in addition to extension behavior configuration. Provided config-sample.js to indicate types of configuration one could use (see also defaultPrefs, defaultExtensions, and defaultConfig within svg-editor.js )
* Added configuration "preventAllURLConfig", "lockExtensions", and/or "preventURLContentLoading" for greater control of what can be configured via URL.
* Allow second argument object to setConfig containing "allowInitialUserOverride" booleans to allow for preference config in config.js to be overridden by URL or preferences in user storage; also can supply "overwrite" boolean in 2nd argument object if set to false to prevent overwriting of any prior-set configuration (URL config/pref setting occurs in this manner automatically for security reasons).
* Allow server_opensave extension to work wholly client-side (if browser supports the download attribute)
* Added WebAppFind extension
* Added new php_savefile extension to replace outdated, non-functioning server-save code; requires user to create "savefile_config.php" file and do any validation there (for their own security)
* Use addEventListener for 'beforeunload' event so user can add their own if desired
* Changed locale behavior to always load from locale file, including English. Allow extensions to add new "langReady" callback which is passed an object with "lang" and "uiStrings" properties whenever the locale data is first made available or changed by the user (this callback will not be invoked until the locale data is available). Extensions can add strings to all locales and utilize this mechanism.
* Made fixes impacting path issues and also ext-connector.js
* Fixed a bug where the position number supplied on an extension object was too high (e.g., if too few other extensions were included, the extension might not show up because its position was set too high).
* Added Polish locale
* Zoom features
* Make extension paths relative within extensions (issue 1184)
* Security improvements and other fixes
* Embedded editor can now work same domain without JSON parsing and the consequent potential loss of arguments or return values.
* Potentially breaking API changes:
    * Disallowed "extPath", "imgPath", "langPath", and "jGraduatePath" setting via URL and prevent cross-domain/cross-folder extensions being set by URL (security enhancement)
    * Deprecated "pngsave" option called by setCustomHandlers() in favor of "exportImage" (to accommodate export of other image types). Second argument will now supply, in addition to "issues" and "svg", the properties "type" (currently 'PNG', 'JPEG', 'BMP', 'WEBP'), "mimeType", and "quality" (for 'JPEG' and 'WEBP' types).
    * Default extensions will now always load (along with those supplied in the URL unless the latter is prohibited by configuration), so if you do not wish your old code to load all of the default extensions, you will need to add &noDefaultExtensions=true to the URL (or add equivalent configuration in config.js). ext-overview_window.js can now be excluded though it is still a default.
    * Preferences and configuration options must be within the list supplied within svg-editor.js (should include those of all documented extensions).
    * Embedded messaging will no longer work by default for privacy/data integrity reasons. One must include the "ext-xdomain-messaging.js" extension and supply an array configuration item, "allowedOrigins" with potential values including: "\*" (to allow all domains--strongly discouraged!), "null" as a string to allow file:// access, window.location.origin (to allow same domain access), or specific trusted origins. The embedded editor works without the extension if the main editor is on the same domain, but if cross-domain control is needed, the "allowedOrigins" array must be supplied by a call to svgEditor.setConfig({allowedOrigins: [origin1, origin2, etc.]}) in the new config.js file.
