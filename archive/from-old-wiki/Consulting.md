As per the [MIT license](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License), you do not have to pay anything to anyone to use or integrate SVG-edit. If you code, we hope that you will choose to re-contribute your fixes and enhancements. Additionally, you may choose to pay for support, training, bug fixes and enhancements.

While there is no official endorsement from the point of view of SVG-edit, below is a list of self-identified consultants, who offer services. We ask that all consultants listed here be active within the community and upstream fixes and enhancements, when it's possible/relevant. Some enhancements are just too specific and it may not be acceptable for the official project code base.
