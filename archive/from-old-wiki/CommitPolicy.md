If you want commit access, just ask marclaporte at gmail.com. We need your Gmail or Google account. Keep in mind that SVG-edit is widely used and changes can have unexpected consequences. If you are planning major changes, it's a good idea to discuss them on the mailing list (and link to a wiki page if you feel it's appropriate)

Please join these two mailing lists: * [General discussion](http://groups.google.com/group/svg-edit) * [All commits, including changes to wiki pages](http://groups.google.com/group/svg-edit-commit)
Where to commit

    If it's a translation: just commit directly. You can even use the web-based interface (awesome!)
        Go to https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/source/browse/trunk/editor/locale/
        Click on your language file
        Click "Edit file"
        Edit the translation file
        File in the box to describe your changes
        Click "Commit"
    If you are sure: just commit
    If you are pretty sure, but have some doubts: commit and ask for a review -> https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews
    If you want some feedback before committing: add a patch to the issue tracker (or if it's simple, can be on the mailing list)
    If you want to do something really radical, make an experimental branch

A corollary to a lower threshold to commit access (than most projets) is quick rollbacks, so don't be offended if your commit is rolled back. This is part of the process of learning and collaborating.
How to give feedback on a commit

You can just comment the commit as per this example: https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/source/detail?r=2274

If you feel it deserves more eyeballs, send a message to the mailing list.

You can also use the Code Review system: https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/CodeReviews
How to commit

    We use Subversion: https://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/SubversionFAQ
