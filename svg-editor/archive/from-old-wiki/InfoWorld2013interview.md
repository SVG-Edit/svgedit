Below is information provided.
What is the purpose of SVG-edit?

SVG-edit is an online vector graphics editor that uses only JavaScript, HTML5, CSS and SVG (i.e. no server-side functionality). It is designed to be embedded in a web application (Wiki, CMS, Groupware, etc.)
What are its main functions?

    Supports all modern browsers
    Integrated with many applications
    Stores drawing data in SVG
    Free-hand drawing, Lines, Polylines, Rectanges, etc.
    Layers
    And many more: https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/#Features

What does SVG-edit do that other SVG tools do not?

Most SVG tools are desktop applications, which makes it more complicated to collaborate.

I am pretty sure it's the Free and Open Source (FOSS) web-based SVG editor with the most features. If there are other projects out there with more / different features, please do get in touch with us so we may collaborate. We have developed an SVG test suite that would surely be useful to you too!

It's also likely the Free and Open Source (FOSS) web-based SVG editor with the most contributors.
Who developed it?

According to Ohloh.net "SVG-edit has had 1,749 commits made by 36 contributors representing 50,115 lines of code" https://www.ohloh.net/p/svg-edit
Is SVG-edit an open source or commercial product? If it is commercial, Can you provide a price range per-seat?

SVG-edit is Free and Open Source software, and community-managed. The license is MIT. So you can embed in your commercial or FOSS project.
How important is SVG, from your perspective?

It is very important to have standards for all data formats, as much as possible. If the tool you use to generate SVG stops being developed, you maintain your assets and can move to a more modern tool. It also protects you against vendor lock-in.
Can you provide some screen shots or URLs with visuals of SVG-edit?

Here is demo of the stable version: http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/branches/2.6/editor/svg-editor.html

Here is a demo of the upcoming version: http://svg-edit.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/editor/svg-editor.html
Any other comments about SVG-edit?

SVG-edit is a community-managed project with a open contribution policy. Join us in making it as good as it can possibly be! We have community conference calls and want to have as many contributors as possible. See: https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/wiki/HowToParticipate

We also have a project to get SVG-edit used on Wikipedia for over half million SVG images there.

There have been 113 000 downloads on Google Code since 2009: https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/downloads/list Also, SVG-edit is embedded in other projects, and we have no way of tracking how many downloads there.
Who is your employer and what is your title there?

I (Marc Laporte) am a volunteer project administrator for SVG-edit, along with others. We do have some consultants which are available to integrate SVG-edit in your application or for adding additional functionality (and let's work together so those features are added to SVG-edit!)
