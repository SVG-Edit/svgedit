Information for students

The Google Summer of Code is a program for students in most countries. You will participate by writing code for a free software project. Students who finish their work satisfactorily will get a stipend of 4500 US Dollars.

Do this if you want to participate:

    Start by reading the [Google Summer of Code FAQ](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2013/help_page)
    See which of the Ideas below you find interesting or come up with your own idea.
    Get in contact with the community
    Submit your proposal on the Google Summer of Code website

Your proposal should include this information:

    Give a detailed idea of what you want to accomplish in your project. Don't just quote what the project's abstract says! Think of how you will actually implement it, and describe that.
    Give a general idea of your skills. If you have participated in a free software project before, say so and if possible point to your contributions.
    Give a rough timeline for your work, with milestones. For example: "week 1, get the code to build and start familiarizing myself with it. Week 2, implement the first refactoring patch. Week 3, try such and such thing."

Basically, let us know why you are the perfect person to implement the project you picked :)
Ideas

This is a list of ideas for projects which could be done as part of the Google Summer of Code program. If you have an idea and want to mentor it, please add it to the list.

If you are a student and want to work on an idea, submit a proposal. You are not limited to the ideas listed here. If you have an own idea or want to approach an idea in a completely different way, feel free to submit this as proposal as well. Sometimes these are the best projects. Creativity and initiative are highly appreciated.
