We need to make it easier to theme svg-edit and tweak the interface. Currently the presentation, markup and logic are mixed in css, html and javascript. Ideally an approach similar to the [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/).
Open questions

    What needs to be changed in the code to make this separation happen?
    What sorts of interface changes would we want possible? Perhaps take inspiration from other editors like [Method Draw](http://editor.method.ac/) and [CWM Draw Tool](https://code.google.com/p/cwm-drawtool/)
