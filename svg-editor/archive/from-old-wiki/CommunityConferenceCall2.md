Topics
Introduction of participants

        Where do you live?
        How do you use SVG-edit? (if this takes more than 30 seconds, please add as a presentation below)
        What is on your mind for this meeting (which topic of the agenda interests you the most)?

Demos/explanation of how SVG-edit is used/integrated

This is for projects that didn't present in the previous call or that have something new to share.
Wikipedia

Being used for Wikipedia will be the biggest surge of usage for SVG-edit (Wikipedia being a top-10 site in the World)

[A round-trip test suite is now in place.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/svg-edit/SfTVM4OPXiA/discussion)

What are the next steps to get there? Who can help?
Release cycle

Let's start the discussion. And we should eventually come up with some realistic and commonly understood guidelines. Some examples: * A release every 6 months like Ubuntu (October and April) * Release at any time (when energy and features are there), but never more than 12 month between releases.
2.7 Release

    What is the code status in trunk?
        [The current list of issues tagged needed for 2.7](https://code.google.com/p/svg-edit/issues/list?can=2&q=NeededFor%3D2.7)
            Let's discuss "real" blockers for a 2.7 release, because the list above is quite long!

Ease of use and skinning platform
Convergence of energy / Roadmap / Revamp
